Content overview:

Data: 
      
      Total emerging insects abundance and biomass data were collected over five weeks

      Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT) abundance data were collected over five weeks
      
      Spider abundance data from two spider taxa (Tetragnatha and Lycosidae)
      
      Pesticide concentrations data from daily water samples
      
      Pesticide concentrations data from treatment sediment samples (Low-flow and Control) collected in weeks 4 and 6
      
      Physicochemical parameters measured from the flume during the experiment
      

Statistics:

      The data was fitted with generalized linear mixed model using glmmTMB: Generalized Linear Mixed Models using Template Model Builder

      The model diagnostics was done with DHARMa

      Pairwise comparison with EMMEAN package

      Summary statistics with rstatix

      Visualization with Tidyverse

      Other package included are: stats and car packages
